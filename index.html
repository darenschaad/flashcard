      <h1>Flashcard for Javascript!</h1>
      <h2>Click the word for the definition</h2>
      <h4 class="clickable">Javascript</h4>
      <p class="showing">An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>
      <h4 class="clickable">Modulo</h4>
      <p class="showing">An operation which finds the remainder .</p>
      <h4 class="clickable">Operators</h4>
      <p class="showing">Operators in JavaScript are very similar to operators that appear in other programming languages. The definition of an operator is a symbol that is used to perform an operation. Most often these operations are arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc), but not always.</p>
      <h4 class="clickable">NaN</h4>
      <p class="showing">Not a number value.</p>
      <h4 class="clickable">Variable naming conventions</h4>
      <p class="showing">Reasons for using a naming convention (as opposed to allowing programmers to choose any character sequence) include the following:
        to reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code,
        to enable code reviews to focus on more important issues than arguing over syntax and naming standards,
        to enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences,
      to enhance source code appearance (for example, by disallowing overlong names or unclear abbreviations).
    </ul></p> <!--Looks like a stray ul tag-->
      <h4 class="clickable">+=</h4>
      <p class="showing">s a shorthand operator.</p>
      <h4 class="clickable">Function</h4>
      <p class="showing">is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value. Most programming languages come with a prewritten set of functions that are kept in a library.</p>
      <h4 class="clickable">Method</h4>
      <p class="showing">in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with an object class. An object is made up of behavior and data. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods. Methods are also the interface an object presents to the outside world.</p>
      <h4 class="clickable">Argument to a method</h4>
      <p class="showing">In computer programming, a parameter is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine.[a] These pieces of data are called arguments.</p>
      <h4 class="clickable">String</h4>
      <p class="showing">In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation).</p>
